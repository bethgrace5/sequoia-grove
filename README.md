Sequoia Grove
==
Simple Employee Scheduling.

Sequoia Grove was designed for businesses following a scheduling system where work schedules
with shifts are written and published weekly. The model for this product was
constructed by researching the current system in place by a  local Delicatessen,
[The Sequoia Sandwich Company](http://www.sequoiasandwich.com/v4/).
The application then expands on the model by being built generically enough
to accommodate any business operating on a similar basis.
Project satisfies senior project requirement for bachelor's degree of computer
science at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB)

* [bower](http://bower.io/) `npm install -g bower`

#### Setup Project
* Install Javascript dependencies: `bower install`
* Install Java dependencies : `mvn clean install`
* jdbc.properties needs database connection credentials in /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/
* liqubase.properties needs database connection credentials in /src/main/resources/liquibase/
* there's probably something I forgot, like jar for postgresql, or something
